# ðŸ”„ Resource-Swap

The "Resource-Swap" is an upcoming feature, which will allow you to balance the quantity of each individual [Resource](/category/essentials) in your [In-Game Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet).&#x20;

Since every [BIT-Token](/tokenomics/bit-token) consists of a **full set** of all four R.Land [Resources](/category/essentials) (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'yellow' }}>Alloy</mark>, \
<mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> and <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>), you can use this feature to optimize your available amount of [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token). The Resource-Swap feature will also be very helpful in the upcoming R.Land [Crafting Game](r.land-crafting-game.md).
