# ðŸ“š R.Land Staking Game

R.Land is soon releasing its very own "Staking Game", which will allow players to vote for their favourite WAX NFT collections using [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) in order for them to earn the [In-Game Token](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/) "[Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards)".

Players will be able to earn [Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards) by simply holding NFTs of the highest voted collections in their [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet). All collections providing basic information will be accepted, without any need for a whitelist.

The daily amount of [Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards) for each collection will depend on their current ranking within the Staking Game. Players will be able to spend [BIT-Tokens ](/tokenomics/bit-token)in order to:

* **Increase** a collections ranking (more [Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards) per day)
* **Decrease** a collections ranking (less [Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards) per day)
* **Increase** the total amount of [Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards) for all collections
* **Decrease** the total amount of [Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards) for all collections

The rewards will be claimable every 24 hours and will reset daily, meaning that you will miss out on some rewards if you do not claim them every day.&#x20;
