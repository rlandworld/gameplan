# ðŸ“– R.Land Player Stories

**We asked our community to share their own personal R.Land Player Stories in a contest format and invited them to give us feedback on the project. The top three voted stories were rewarded with prizes. Here is what they had to say:**\

## _Player Story #1_ _by_ _Mat | R.Land Peace Leader_

It all started with a friend telling me about a very talented developer named Bad Gifter _(note: R.Land's main developer)_. My friend told me his new project named R.Land is about to drop their first NFTâ€™s.\
\
I was not very into it at the start but still decided to participate in the giveaway that R.Land organised. 5 players were able to get refunded their Aether which they invested in the OS pack sale back in October 2021. I won the giveaway the day of my birthday, 50 000 000 Aether and unpacked a Mythic OS from my Whale pack, from there everything started.\
\
The game has been more and more interesting, discord mining was released and it was great to upgrade my Axe and Lands, bought a few Gold Axes and Mythic Lands before the launch when they were at their cheapest on the market and I was set for a big mining journey into R.Land. The game was so addicting that I felt obliged to get more assets, OS, Boosters and ... I managed to get in contact with one of the 2 remaining Black Diamond BIT holders (very hard to find), he did not use it in the discord mining game yet.&#x20;

He offered it to me at 100 000 wax but I was not able to afford it. Talked a lot with the person and managed to get a really good price for the Mythic Axe, 20 000 wax (only?!) and I managed to level it up to the quarter of the max level so far! _(note: Current Max. Level is 100 000)._ It is mining a lot of BIT and needs a lot of pixel water to cool it! Also managed to have a few Gold axes at the optimal level to farm XP, I feel like XP will be important in the future too. I promise to take care of her just like Babygirl _(note: R.Land's mascott and lead scientist)_ cares about her toys.&#x20;

Being present and around the Discord allowed me to help the mods and some other OG players to write the Quick Start guide and the future whitepapar release, hint: It will be awesome! _(note: you are reading it right now)._ The community in discord is something really important for me and I try to be as much active as I can to talk with the players engaging with the community around the project, made a lot of good friend and really looking forward to see you all at the 2023 super secret conference! \
\
My advice for new players: Buy them all! Get a Gold axe and some Mythic OS and lands, they are pretty accessible on the market right now. I am really looking forward to have some minigames in R.Land and I feel like the staking battles will be epic! The R.Land story is just getting started...&#x20;

## _Player Story #2 by Nico Pez | R.Land Pet_

When I first started on this ecosystem, I was lost. In my life i was a continuously looking for something created to fit on me. I had many years behind of scaping from my old life, where I had a rough time of wealth illness, followed by party and drugs (very unhealthy, don't recommend it), and I was not reaching this target already, but I was very decided on what I wanted. I JUST WANTED TO STOP LOOSING MONEY ON CRYPTO (from 2018), and start using my knowledge I did on it for generating some kind of value. \
\
My research was very extensive and a good way to keep training my brain into making decisions, practicing communication, ask, learn, and analyze if what I was picking today is my thing, or not. My path was not certain, and as I became a digital nomad escaping from my country and my own reality... Then I knew the NFT's were the right choice and I just decided to drop out some of my other areas of crypto-interest and go for it with all. \
\
Long story short: after blewing my mind numerous times, I ended up finding R.Land. It was easy to understand why it was born, and why do I fit on it. The bases were completely different to any other WAX project, having all the elements that makes me think that yes, it's an smart project on which I'll fit pretty well and have a lot of fun. \
\
I went big on Owner Shard packs, and invested lots of time on thinking, calculating, figuring out the model, and understanding the fudamental economics proposed of the R.Land metaverse. On the meantime I got involved in the aesthetics, the rune words, and the animals being the main actors of it.

The beautiful thing is, I started this all alone, and ended up with a lot of new friends! We created a sort of collaborative space where everyone that feels that can give something, can put it into the table and "donate" his brain to help this metaverse to develop and grow. That made me improve myself a lot, on the way that I finally managed to get out of a big loop of watching around, hearing voices, being confused and try everything without a clear road.&#x20;

Since then I found out that mining could be much more than click on a window. It's very complex to create a good and healthy economy, and is important to be wise, and try to deeply understand what is better to improve this. I think these things made me grow a lot lately, and I feel very grateful because my entire life changed since R.Land is part of my life. I really have a long-term vision on this, that i can use to project my own life, so I finally can link my meta-life with my real-life. \
\
P.D.: I got much more centered, I'm about to have a daughter (now is 1.90kg yeeiii), and have almost finished an intensive course of Industrial Machine Programming, where I learnt to do many things for real world, for real money. But I'll still always keep my big fat bag of BITs, and OS, miners, Actions, and all which this game brings me and I manage to do!

## _Player Story #3 by Funkocoffee_

I saw Bad Gifter on the Youtube channel for the Uplifters. His interview with Corey was very interesting. I bought a few Owner Shards and accumulated some things over the course of a few months. The discord channel was very helpful any time I had questions someone was very quick to answer.

I took the plunge into mining near the end of the discord system, once the web mining started I became totally addicted. I find it very satisfying to upgrade my Axes and Lands everyday. Bad Gifters support of us during the R-Planet staking program was tremendous. Staking Owner Shards was extraordinarily profitable. The upcoming R.Land staking system has me over the moon excited!

I feel part of a team with the R.Land group. The more sucessful the whole project and their participants are the more successful I will be as well. I am excited about the future of the project. LFG!!!

## _Player Story #4 by Arkyris | cpunow.io_

**R.Land: A New Hope - My R.Land Story by Arkyris - November: Two Thousand Twenty-One** \
\
The writing was on the wall crypto winter was fast approaching... Actually we need to go back further. \
\
**Chapter 1: The crypto saga begins - February: Two Thousand Twenty-One** \
\
"Crypto is dumb, decentralization is cool but whats the point if you cant use it for anything". This was my mindset, however NFTs were taking off and while spending 10s of thousands of dollars on an ugly monkey photo seemed just as dumb I still needed to find out more. My googling led to learning about NFTs and their utility in gaming.\
\
First stop Wombat, the mistplay of crypto at the time. This lasted all of a week. Shitty games that lost your save data constantly and give you pennies a week if you play constantly. Upland was advertising hard at this time so that was stop two. It was actually kinda fun, required some strategy and not much attention. Then I found dapp radar. Enter Alien Worlds/WAX. Over the course of the summer I made some great friends, learned a lot and unfortunately bought in to some bad projects, which everyone does as some point when starting out.\
\
**Chapter 2: Winter is coming - Back to November**\
\
A team I thought I could trust set up a money funnel and did not at all have the best interest of it's players in mind. This greatly changed how I approach any new project. And I essentially don't any more. I also exited or am in the process of exiting everything but R.Land. So what does R.Land have that other projects dont? Or at least not enough of. \
\
The initial sale used a dying coin and gave it new use. Then all those proceeds went to further benefit the players. An engaging and responsive dev who is quick to squash bugs and correct errors. And also goes out of his way to help people with their questions even if they have nothing to do with RLand. An understanding of scarcity, and the importance of not having a new sale every couple weeks. Balanced and scalable mechanics with long term goals that take time to reach. Not run by a corporation. And of course the best community on wax.

## Player Story #5 by Buckizard

I guess Iâ€™m the late comer here. Somehow missed this project until hearing something about it in another projectâ€™s discord. Itâ€™s been a short under a month for me. I started with a common axe lvl 1, a common rGas lvl 1, and a 2x boosterâ€¦ all off secondary market as there were no drops or public mining. Just mined and kept clicking every so often for about a week. \
\
Then I learned a little more. Currently I have rare axe lvl 10, rare axe lvl 8, uc axe lvl 5, and still my common axe at lvl 1. Lands are uc circuit lvl 1664, rare circuit lvl 53, common rGas lvl 1016, common alloy lvl 1001, common rGas lvl 105. Basically, been just rotating through mining the elements trying to maximize bit. Not sure what I enjoy the most about this projectâ€¦yet. Still learning.\
\
But I love the interface is clean and easy to understand and I feel like I can still progress, even though Iâ€™m late to the party. Advice to new player...like myself: read the whitepaper. Honestly, so many projects involved in, I let it slip, and still need to read more thorough. Look for deals if just getting into. I did not know higher levels can get you more than rarity and there are some above 1000 level lands at below level 1s. Thatâ€™s one I wish Iâ€™d known. Also it takes all the elements to make BITs. I was wondering why I was mining but BITs were not going anywhere until I realized I was missing an element. Not a big social discord guy but loving what Iâ€™m seeing with this project and the peeps, staying involved and mining along! Just noticed im missing pixel so will have to fix that.

## Player Story #6 by Fk#ng Miner

For me it was just a coincidence, I had some Aether and I saw the Drop, I thought it was great to be able to buy a Whale Pack, the largest, at that time I still handled smaller amounts of wax, and getting one of the big packs was exciting .

In the end I had the opportunity to get more packs, when this was just beginning. Then I took advantage of the blend event to enhance my collection, a bit of strategy here, another bit of luck here, and without realizing it I had 8 mythics and a small but good loot on my hands.

It was funny, the aesthetics and the community made me not doubt much, besides I have to be honest and say that without a doubt I have made a profit, and I regret a little not buying more xp on Dr. Baby Girl birthday.

I am grateful that I have always been able to find a kind answer, smart advice or a word of encouragement in the bad days and in the worst.
