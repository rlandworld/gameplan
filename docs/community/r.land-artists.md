## What is R.Land-Artists?

"[R.Land-Artists](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rlandartists\&order=desc\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX)" is a fan-art collection dedicated to R.Land. The collection launched on May, 10th 2022 and was whitelisted :white\_check\_mark: by [AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/) on September, 2nd 2022.

The objectives of the [R.Land-Artists](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rlandartists\&order=desc\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) collection are:

* Providing incentives for the community to create fan-art about R.Land (including images and videos, as well as podcasts, blogs, etc.)
* Rewarding players for holding [R.Land-Artists](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rlandartists\&order=desc\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) NFTs by staking them for [Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards) on [R.Land](https://r.land/)
* Animating the [R.Land](https://r.land/) community and contributing to the project's growth
* Being accessible to everyone, new players as well as veterans

At the moment, the collection includes two schemas: [Fanmade NFTs](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rlandartists\&order=desc\&schema\_name=fanmade\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) & [Raffle Coins](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rlandartists\&order=desc\&schema\_name=coins\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX)

### Fanmade NFTs

</div>

As the name suggests, this part of the collection displays a selection of the best [R.Land](https://r.land/)-related NFTs, which were made by fans.

Owners of [Fanmade NFTs](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rlandartists\&order=desc\&schema\_name=fanmade\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) will be able to stake them on [R.Land](https://r.land/) in order to earn [Shards](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/shards). Another benefit of owning [Fanmade NFTs](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rlandartists\&order=desc\&schema\_name=fanmade\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) will be earning from the [AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/) fees, generated by the collection's sales on the platform. These features will be activated together with the launch of the [Staking Game](/upcoming-features/r.land-staking-game). The commission will be credited monthly.

:::success
25% of the funds generated from the initial drop of each [Fanmade NFT](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rlandartists\&order=desc\&schema\_name=fanmade\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) are paid to the respective artist.
