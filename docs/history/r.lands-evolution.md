## The Beginning: Discord Mining (Late 2021)

Discord Mining was first released in late 2021 as an Discord-only Mining Game. You had to interact with a Discord bot to start and stop mining, claim and swap [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas).

You already earned [Experience Points (XP)](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp) and were able to start [Upgrading](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading) your [Land and Tool Contracts](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) (ownership was not available yet) and the race to the highest level was launched!

## First Milestone: Web-Mining Game 1.0 (Early 2022)

After a few months of hard work by Dr. Baby Girl, the first webmining version 1.0 was released. The [Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) In-Game Token made its first appearance in order to set limits on daily [Upgrading](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading).&#x20;

Later in the year, the [In-Game Token Markets](/tokenomics/in-game-token-markets) for [Experience Points (XP)](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp) and [Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) were added into the game, completely handing over the [In-Game Token](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/) economy to the players.

## Today: Web-Mining Game 2.0 (Early 2023)

R.Land had to get ready for future cross-chain integration and other advanced features. This resulted in the need for a redesigned website and improved backend in order to untie the direct connection to the WAX blockchain and to allow the [R.Land In-Game Wallet](/essentials/creating-an-r.land-in-game-wallet) creation via e-mail and social media accounts.&#x20;
