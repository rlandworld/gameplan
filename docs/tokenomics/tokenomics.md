# ðŸ“Š Tokenomics

:::info
As of today, the tokenomics of [R.Land](https://play.r.land/mine) are still in development and only partly implemented. However, our goal is to create a lasting and sustainable economy using a comprehensive tokenomics model with distinctive and unique mechanics.

:::info
The R.Land project is always committed to maintain a stable and lasting economy by implementing mechanics that limit token inflation and preserve asset values. For example, the supply of [BIT-Tokens](bit-token.md) (in particular through the mining of [Resources](in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas.md)) is already limited by the available supply of [Lands](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) and [Tools](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) as well as the constantly decreasing amount of available [Boosters](/nfts/boosters).

Therefore, there might be additional measures taken in the future to adjust the supply of specific tokens or assets in order to maintain an overall healthy ecosystem.&#x20;
