# ðŸ“ˆ In-Game Token Markets

R.Land's In-Game Token Markets are dynamic player-driven pools, which can be used to exchange [In-Game Tokens](in-game-tokens/) like [Experience Points](in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp.md) and [Actions](in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da.md) for [BIT-Tokens](bit-token.md), or vice versa.&#x20;

## Buy/Sell Rates

Buy and Sell rates adjust dynamically based on demand and supply of each token. However, to keep exchange rates from diverging to far from the intended price range, our system regularly adjusts the price for some tokens to the intended target rates.

:::info
In the future all In-Game Tokens Markets will be fully player-driven.

## **Actions Fee (Currently not enabled!)**

Interacting with the In-Game Token Markets requires a certain amount of [Actions](in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da.md) depending on the amount of tokens you want to exchange:

* Buying or Selling [Experience Points](in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp.md) requires 1 Action per 250 BIT-Tokens being transacted.
* Buying or Selling [Actions](in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da.md) is currently free!
* Withdrawing [BIT-Tokens](bit-token.md) requires 1 Action per 1 000 [BIT-Tokens](bit-token.md) being withdrawn.
* Buying [BIT-Tokens](bit-token.md) is currently free!

Actions Fees are subject to change based on the voting of [Owner Shards](/nfts/owner-shards-os) holders!
