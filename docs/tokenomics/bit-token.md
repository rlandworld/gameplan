# ðŸ“€ BIT-Token

## What is a BIT-Token?

The main token of the R.Land project is called "BIT-Token", or simply "BIT". BIT-Tokens can be transferred directly between your [In-Game Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) and your [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet), making it the sole R.Land token to have utility outside of the game itself.&#x20;

However, this isn't the only aspect that makes BIT-Tokens unique. Every single BIT also consists of each of the four R.Land [Resources](in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas.md) (<b style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</b>, <b style={{ color:'orange' }}>Alloy</b>, <b style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</b>, <b style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</b>), which can be mined in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/):

 1x BIT = 1x <b style={{ color:'green' }}> Circuit </b> + 1x <b style={{ color:'orange' }}> Alloy </b> + 1x <b style={{ color:'red' }}> rGas </b> + 1x <b style={{ color:'blue' }}> Pixel </b>

In other words, a BIT-Token is automatically created for each **full set** of all four [Resources](in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas.md) in your [In-Game Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet). For example:&#x20;

* 12x <b style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</b>, 24x <b style={{ color:'orange' }}>Alloy</b>, 23x <b style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</b> & 42x <b style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</b> = _**12x**_ BIT-Tokens
* 700x <b style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</b>, 139x <b style={{ color:'orange' }}>Alloy</b>, 256x <b style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</b> & 99x <b style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</b> = _**99x**_ BIT-Tokens

Consequently, the lowest amount of any of the four [Resources](in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas.md) in your [In-Game Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) will determine the amount of BIT-Tokens in your balance:

:::warning
Remember that [Resources](in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas.md) are [In-Game Tokens](in-game-tokens/) and therefore cannot be withdrawn to your [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) directly. However, withdrawing [BIT-Tokens](bit-token.md) will automatically deduct the respective amount of Resources from your [In-Game Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) as well.

:::success
In order to receive BIT-Tokens, [Resources](in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas.md) can either be mined _actively_ by playing in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) or _passively_ by simply holding [Owner Shards](/nfts/owner-shards-os) in your [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet).

:::success
The upcoming[ Resource-Swap ](/upcoming-features/resource-swap)feature will allow you to balance your [Resource](in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas.md) quantities and maximize the amount of available BIT-Tokens.

## How to purchase BIT-Tokens?

BIT-Tokens are available for purchase on the following third-party exchanges:&#x20;

* BIT/WAX Swap and Liquidity-Pool is available on [Defibox](https://wax.defibox.io/betDetail/131).&#x20;
* BIT/WAX bet is available on [Alcor](https://alcor.exchange/trade/bit-rland\_wax-eosio.token).

:::info
It is recommended to trade BIT-Tokens on [Defibox](https://wax.defibox.io/betDetail/131), since [Alcor](https://alcor.exchange/trade/bit-rland\_wax-eosio.token) currently has only limited liquidity.
