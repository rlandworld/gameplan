# ðŸ’¿ In-Game Tokens

In addition to R.Land's main [BIT-Token](/bit-token) there are several other In-Game Tokens, which are solely used within the game and cannot be withdrawn directly:

* [**Resources**](resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas.md)&#x20;
* [**Actions**](actions-sa-da.md)
* [**Experience Points**](experience-points-xp.md)
* [**Shards**](shards.md)
* [**Energy**](energy.md)

:::success
Some In-Game Tokens like [Actions](actions-sa-da.md) and [Experience Points ](experience-points-xp.md)can be exchanged for [BIT-Tokens](/bit-token), or vice versa, on the player-driven [In-Game Token Markets](/in-game-token-markets).
