## What are Experience Points (XP)?

"Experience Points" are an [In-Game Token](/in-game-token-markets) in R.Land used to upgrade [Lands and Tools](/nfts/lands-and-tools), as well as [Land and Tool Contracts](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts). They can be obtained by playing the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) or by purchasing them with [BIT-Tokens](/bit-token) on the [In-Game Token Markets](/in-game-token-markets).

:::warning
Similiar to other [In-Game Tokens](./), Experience Points exist only inside the game and can not be withdrawn to your [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) directly.
:::

:::info
In the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) the amount of Experience Points (XP) earned per mining session equals 8% of the [Resource](/category/essentials) production per minute (RPM) of the used [Tool](/nfts/lands-and-tools), up to a maximum of 1 XP per minute for each [Land](/nfts/lands-and-tools) or [Land Contract](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) you are mining on.
:::

## Why are Experience Points (XP) needed?

Players can use Experience Points to upgrade their [Lands and Tools](/nfts/lands-and-tools), or [Land and Tool Contracts](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts), within the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) in order to increase their [Resource](resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) production, as well as the duration of their mining sessions. 

If your [Contract](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) level reaches level 1 000 (or higher) you can receive ownership of your [Lands and Tools](/nfts/lands-and-tools), by either trading them in together with a matching [Bonus Ticket](/nfts/tickets.md#land-and-tool-bonus-tickets), or by purchasing the ownership with [BIT-Tokens](/bit-token). Learn more about [Obtaining Full Ownership From Contracts](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts.md#obtaining-full-ownership-from-contracts).

:::info
Need more Experience Points? There is a rumour that an Experience Points NFT drop (similar to the [Daily Actions NFT](/nfts/daily-actions-nfts) drop) might happen in the future.
