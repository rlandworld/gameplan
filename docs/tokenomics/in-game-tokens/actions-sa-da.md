## What are Actions?

Being one of the essential [In-Game Tokens](./) of R.Land, "Actions" are needed for almost anything a player can do within the game, including (but not limited to):

* Mining in the R.Land [Mining Game](/../gaming/r.land-mining-game/)
* Buying and Selling [Experience Points (XP)](experience-points-xp.md)
* Upgrading [Lands](broken-reference), [Tools](broken-reference) and [Contracts](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts)
* Withdrawing [BIT-Tokens](/bit-token) to your [Wax-Wallet](/../essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet)
* Renting [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) and [Tools](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) with [Public Mining (Free-To-Play)](/../gaming/r.land-mining-game/public-mining-free-to-play).

There are two different types of Actions available:

* Single Actions (SA)
* Daily Actions (DA)

Daily Actions (DA) and Single Actions (SA) can be used in the same way. They only differentiate by the fact that Daily Actions (DA) get refilled automatically after 24 hours, and Single Action (SA) simply get consumed once used. \
\
The total amount of Actions you see in your balance is based on the sum of the remaining Daily Actions (DA) for that specific day and your available amount of Single Actions (SA):

**Actions = Daily Actions (DA) + Single Actions (SA)**

:::warning
Similar to other [In-Game Tokens](./), Actions exist only inside the game and can not be withdrawn to your [WAX Wallet](/../essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) directly.&#x20;
:::

:::info
When spending Actions, Daily Actions (DA) are always consumed first.
:::

:::success
Don't feel like playing R.Land's [Mining Game](/../gaming/r.land-mining-game/), but still want to earn some [BIT-Tokens](/bit-token)? One of the easiest alternatives is selling [In-Game Tokens](./) like Actions for [BIT-Tokens](/bit-token) on the player-driven [In-Game Token Markets](/in-game-token-markets).
:::

## What are Single Actions (SA)?

Actions, which can only be used once and do not regenerate, are call Single Actions (SA). Single Actions have to be purchased on the [In-Game Tokens Markets](/in-game-token-markets) and are not obtainable in other ways.

:::success
You can also trade Single Actions for [BIT-Tokens](/bit-token) on the [In-Game Token Markets](/in-game-token-markets).
:::

## What are Daily Actions?

"Daily Actions" are a special kind of Actions which are regenerated to your available Actions balance every 24 hours, on a rolling basis, after being used.\
\
They get credited to your R.Land [In-Game Wallet](/../essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) automatically by owning certain R.Land assets, such as:

* [Daily Action NFTs](/../nfts/daily-actions-nfts)
* [Owner Shards (OS)](/../nfts/owner-shards-os)
* [Lands](broken-reference) and [Land Contracts](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts)
* [Tools](broken-reference) and [Tool Contracts](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) (only "Rare" and above rarity)

:::info
Daily Actions do not stack, so make sure the use all your available Daily Actions within  every 24 hours.
:::

:::success
New players will start out with 50 Daily Actions for free (until a certain threshold), allowing them to take part in the [Public Mining (Free-To-Play)](/../gaming/r.land-mining-game/public-mining-free-to-play).

</div>

The dedicated [Daily Action NFTs](/../nfts/daily-actions-nfts) can generate between 1 and 1000 Daily Actions, depending on their respective mint number. Some of the very rare "[Bonus Daily Action NFTs](/../nfts/daily-actions-nfts)" also can provide over 1000 Daily Actions!

:::success
Need more Daily Actions? The [Daily Action Pack](/../nfts/packs.md#daily-action-pack) drop is happening right now on [R.Land](https://play.r.land/drop). Supply is limited!
:::

:::success
Players can receive discounts for the [Daily Action Pack](/../nfts/packs.md#daily-action-pack) drop (up to 75% total) by providing liquidity to the [BIT/Wax Liquidity Pool](broken-reference) on [Defibox](https://wax.defibox.io/marketDetail/131) and staking the respective liquidity tokens (BOXEA) for at least 90 days on R.Land.

</div>

[Owner Shards](broken-reference), [Lands](broken-reference) and [Land Contracts](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) generate the following amounts of Daily Actions, depending on their rarity:

| Asset Rarity (OS, Land, Land Contract) | Daily Actions |
| -------------------------------------- | :-----------: |
| Common                                 |       1       |
| Uncommon                               |       2       |
| Rare                                   |       6       |
| Epic                                   |       12      |
| Legendary                              |       36      |
| Mythic                                 |      125      |

### Tools and Tool Contracts

</div>

Some of the higher rarity [Tools](broken-reference) and [Tool Contracts](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) also generate Daily Actions:

| Asset Rarity (Tool, Tool Contract) | Daily Actions |
| ---------------------------------- | :-----------: |
| Rare (Multi Pickaxe)               |       5       |
| Epic (Silver Pickaxe)              |       10      |
| Legendary (Gold Pickaxe)           |       25      |
| Mythic (Black Diamond Pickaxe)     |      2500     |

## Why are Actions needed?

The introduction of the "Actions" token aims to ensure long-term sustainability of the R.Land ecosystem by limiting the player's ability to advance too rapidly without interacting with the game on a regular basis. It is designed to prevent big players from immediately achieving exponential progress by simply spending huge amounts of tokens.&#x20;

Consequently, purchasing a lot of Actions at once can be very costly due to the built in [In-Game Token Market](/in-game-token-markets) dynamics, ensuring that the price increases exponentially when large amounts are purchased in a short period of time.

:::success
Need more Actions? You can purchase Actions on the [In-Game Token Markets](/in-game-token-markets) using [BIT-Tokens](/bit-token).&#x20;
