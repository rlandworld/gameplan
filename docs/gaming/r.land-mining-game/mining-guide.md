# ‚ùî Mining Guide

You already own [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands), [Tools ](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools)or [Contracts](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) for the Mining Game? Awesome! Follow these steps to begin your mining adventure:

* Visit the offical R.Land Mining Game [Website](https://play.r.land/mine) and log in with your R.Land In-Game Account. If you did not create an account yet, visit [Creating an R.Land In-Game Account](/../essentials/creating-an-r.land-in-game-wallet) and [Link your WAX Wallet](/../essentials/creating-an-r.land-in-game-wallet.md#2.-link-your-wax-wallet-to-your-r.land-account-2fa).&#x20;
* After successfully logging in, your mining homepage will appear. Make sure the "Mine" Tab at the bottom is selected.
* Click the big "Click to start mining"-button in the center of the screen (you can minimize this button by clicking on the "X"-icon in the top right corner of the card):

* A new window will appear. You are now able to create a new mining session:

<figure><img src="/img/create mining session_comp.png" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Creating a new Mining Session<br/></p></figcaption></figure>

* First you need to select a Mining [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) (or [Tool Contract](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts)) to start a new mining session. Click the "Select Tool"-button.&#x20;

:::info
The duration of each mining session is determined by the [Level](upgrading.md) of your selected [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) (or [Tool Contract](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts)). Each [Level](upgrading.md) adds 1 minute of mining time. \
\
For example, at [Level](upgrading.md) 1 000 the mining session would last for 1 000 minutes (or 16,66 hours).
:::

* A new window will appear, listing all the R.Land Mining Tools available in your [WAX Wallet](/../essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) (ordered by name, ID and mint number). In addition, the remaining available RPM ([**R**esources](/../tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) **P**er **M**inute), the total available RPM and the current [Level](upgrading.md) of each [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) is displayed. Choose your desired [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) (or [Tool Contract](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts)) from the list by simply clicking on it:

<figure><img src="/img/select tool_comp.png" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Selecting a Tool or Tool Contract</p></figcaption></figure>

* After selecting a [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools), you will be redirected to the "Create Mining Session" window. The [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) is now selected:

<figure><img src="/img/tool selected_comp.png" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Your Tool has been selected</p></figcaption></figure>

* Depending on your [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) rarity, you can now choose up to four different [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) (or [Land Contracts](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts)) to mine on.

:::info
Each [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) can mine on a certain amount of [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) at once, depending on its rarity.
:::

* By clicking on any "Select Land"-button, a "Select Mining Land" window will appear, listing all the R.Land Mining [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) available in your [WAX Wallet](/../essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) (ordered by name, ID and mint number). In addition, the remaining available RPM ([**R**esources](/../tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) **P**er **M**inute), the total available RPM and the current [Level](upgrading.md) of each [Land](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) is displayed. Select the [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) (or [Land Contracts](/../nfts/land-and-tool-contracts)) from the list by simply clicking on it:

<figure><img src="/img/select lands_comp.png" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Selecting a Land or Land Contract</p></figcaption></figure>

* Repeat this step for every available [Land](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) slot.

:::info
When selecting [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) to mine on, it is best practice to choose [Lands ](/../nfts/lands-and-tools)with an RPM value that matches the RPM value of your [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) for optimal mining results.
:::

* You will be redirected back to the "Create Mining Session" window. The [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) are now selected:

<figure><img src="/img/lands selected.png" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Your Lands are selected</p></figcaption></figure>

* Now that the [Tools](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) and [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) are successfully selected, you can create the new mining session by clicking on the "Create Session"-button.
* If you would like to add a [Booster](/../nfts/boosters) to your newly created mining session, you now have the option to do so:

<figure><img src="/img/select booster_comp.png" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Adding a Booster to your Mining Session</p></figcaption></figure>

* Congratulations! Your mining session is now completely set up. Click the "Start Mining"-button to start your new mining session (be aware that a certain amount of [Actions](/../tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) will be required to start).
* You will be redirected to your mining homepage. The newly created mining session will be visible and active:

:::info
In our example, the Legendary Gold Pickaxe is mining at a rate of 550,5445 RPM. \
\
An 8x [Booster](/../nfts/boosters) is applied to the mining session, which has a duration of 22d 10h 22m remaining. \
\
This [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) has been upgraded to level 100 000 (current max. Level available via [Upgrading](upgrading)) and will mine for another 69D 10H 37m unless manually stopped.
:::

:::info
Each of the four selected Mythic [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) has a total capacity of 550,5614 RPM, so additional mining on this [Land](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) could be performed by repeating the steps above using another [Tool](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) and the same [Lands](/../nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands).
:::

:::info
You can disable the confirmation pop-ups for starting, claiming, stopping and deleting mining sessions in the "Skip Confirmation Popup"-menu within the sidebar.
