## The R.Land Mining Game 2.0

The release of the R.Land Mining Game was the project's first major milestone and has been the main focus of development in 2022. What started out as a discord-only minigame has since evolved into a full fledged [Webmining Experience](https://play.r.land/mine):

The Mining Game offers players an enjoyable, exciting, and rewarding way of accumulating the tokens needed for the upcoming [Staking Game](/upcoming-features/r.land-staking-game) and [Crafting Game](/upcoming-features/r.land-crafting-game), while at the same time building a solid economic foundation for future extensions.

In January 2023, we released the first version of the Mining Game 2.0, including a completely reworked user interface and a brand new backend infrastructure, allowing for optimal performance and real-time data capability. Of course, we will continuously update and improve the game over the coming months to bring our users the best possible experience as well as many new and exciting mechanics.

In the following chapters we will guide you through everything you need to know about the R.Land Mining Game 2.0, so you can prepare yourself for what is yet to come!
