# ‚è´ Upgrading

Your [Lands](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands), [Tools](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) and [Contracts](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) can be upgraded up to a max. level of 100 000 to significantly improve their [Resource](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) mining rates (RPM). It is best practice to have the [Land](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands) and [Tool](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) mining capabilities (RPM) have matching values for the most efficient mining results.

Leveling up your [Tools](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) or [Tool Contracts](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) also extends the duration of your mining sessions by 1 minute for each level. After reaching level 1 000 or higher on any [Contract](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts), you can [Obtain Ownership From Contracts](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts.md#obtaining-ownership-from-contracts).

In order to perform an upgrade you need "[Experience Points](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp)" (XP) as well as "[Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da)", more precisely 1 [Action](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) per 250 XP spent on upgrading. 

The XP costs for [Land](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#lands), [Tool](/nfts/lands-and-tools.md#tools) and [Contract](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) upgrades are as follows:

|            XP needed            | Common | Uncommon | Rare | Epic | Legendary | Mythic |
| :-----------------------------: | :----: | :------: | :--: | :--: | :-------: | :----: |
| <p>Land / <br/>Land Contract</p> |    1   |     4    |  10  |  20  |     60    |   250  |
| <p>Tool / <br/>Tool Contract</p> |   300  |    300   |  350 |  400 |    450    |  1500  |

:::info
The amount of "[Experience Points](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp)" (XP) earned per mining session equals 8% of the [Resource](/essentials) production per minute (RPM) of the used [Tool](/nfts/lands-and-tools), up to a maximum of 1 XP per minute for each [Land](/essentials) or [Land Contract](/nfts/land-and-tool-contracts) you are mining on.
