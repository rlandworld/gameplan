During the "Daily Actions-NFT Pack Discount" event, players have the opportunity to receive up to 75% total discount on [Daily Actions-NFT Packs](daily-actions-nft-pack-discount.md) by providing liquidity on [Defibox ](https://wax.defibox.io/marketDetail/131)and staking BOXEA-Tokens for 90 days on [R.Land/drop](https://play.r.land/drop).

## Discount Details

There are two kinds of discounts available:

1. "Group Discount": \
   Decreases the pack price for _everyone_ by 0.2% per 1,000 WAX value of the bilateral pool depth on [Defibox](https://wax.defibox.io/marketDetail/131) (up to **max. 50%** discount on the _initial_ price). This group discount is automatically applied when trying to purchase Daily Actions-NFT Packs on [R.Land/drop](https://play.r.land/drop).
2. "Personal Discount": \
   Decreases the pack price for _individuals_ by an additional 0.5% per 1,000,000,000 (1B) BOXEA-Tokens staked for 90 days on [R.Land/drop](https://play.r.land/drop) (up to **max. 50%** _additional_ discount on top of the _group discount_ price). This personal discount is a one-time discount for one pack purchase. You can create new personal discount for each pack you want to buy.
