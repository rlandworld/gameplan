## What are Daily Actions-NFTs?&#x20;

Daily Actions-NFTs are dedicated assets used to provide additional [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) for players. They were first obtainable exclusively during the [Daily Actions-NFT Pack](packs.md#daily-actions-packs) Sale in July 2022.

[Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) are one of the essential [In-Game Tokens](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/) in R.Land and are needed for basically everything a player can do within the game, including (but not limited to):

* Mining [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) in the [R.Land Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/)
* Buying and Selling [Experience Points (XP)](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp)
* Upgrading [Lands and Tools](lands-and-tools.md), as well as [Land and Tool Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md)
* Withdrawing [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) from your [In-Game Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet) to your [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet)
* Renting [Lands](lands-and-tools.md#lands) and [Tools](lands-and-tools.md#tools) with [Public Mining (Free-To-Play)](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/public-mining-free-to-play).

Each Daily Actions-NFT grants the player a set amount of [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da), matching the number displayed on the respective NFT. This number, in turn, is equivalent to the NFT's mint number.&#x20;

For example: \
A Daily Actions-NFT with mint number #1 will provide 1 [Daily Action](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da), while mint number #1000 will provide 1000 [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da).

:::info
[Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) are a special kind of [Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da), as they get refilled automatically every 24-hours on a rolling basis, and are only obtainable by possessing specific R.Land assets, such as the dedicated Daily Actions-NFTs.&#x20;

In contrast, "normal" Actions, which can only be used once, are called "Single Actions" and are purchaseable directly on the [In-Game Tokens Markets](/tokenomics/in-game-token-markets).
