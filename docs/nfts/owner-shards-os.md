## What are Owner Shards?

Owner Shard NFTs (OS) are a key foundational component to R.Land and were the first NFTs released by our project.

With their ability to passively produce [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas), while at the same time earning from in-game fees and [AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rland\&order=desc\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX)-fees automatically, they represent the perfect basis to start your personal R.Land journey!&#x20;

Amongst several other [Benefits](owner-shards-os.md#benefits), Owner Shards can also be used to begin your R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) adventure by trading them in for [Land Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts). Actively playing has the potential to significantly increase your [Resource](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) production!

Owner Shards were first obtainable exclusively during the [Owner Shard Pack](packs.md) Sale in October 2021.

:::warning
Trading in Owner Shards for [Land Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md) and [Owner Shard Blending](owner-shards-os.md#blending) have reduced the available supply of these assets considerably. The supply will stay limited as there will be no additional sales of [Owner Shards Packs](packs.md#os-packs) in the future!

## Variants

Owner Shards are available in four different variants. Each variant encapsulates and represents one of four different [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) used in R.Land (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'yellow' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> and <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>).&#x20;

![Mythic Circuit OS](</img/Honeycam_2023-01-13_16-19-37.webp>) ![Mythic Alloy OS](</img/Honeycam_2023-01-13_16-19-22.webp>) ![Mythic rGas OS](</img/Honeycam_2023-01-13_16-19-55.webp>) ![Mythic Pixel OS](</img/Honeycam_2023-01-13_16-19-47.webp>)

Each different Owner Shard variant automatically produces its respective [Resource ](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas)type, simply by holding them in your [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet). [Resources ](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas)are needed to create [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) and will be used for R.Land's upcoming [Crafting Game](/upcoming-features/r.land-crafting-game).&#x20;

## Rarities

Each Owner Shard variant is available in six different rarities ranging from "Common" to "Mythic":&#x20;

<div>

|   Mythic  |           1500x           |   AtomicHub-Fees + **Super Secret**  |

Same [Benefits](owner-shards-os.md#benefits) and [Resource](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) production rates apply to all four Owner Shard variants (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'yellow' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> and <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>).

## Blending

## Trading in Owner Shards for Land Contracts

Owner Shards can be traded in for [Land Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md) by using the dedicated trade-in feature on [R.Land](https://r.land/tradein).&#x20;

Simply trade-in an [Owner Shard](owner-shards-os.md) of any rarity or variant (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'yellow' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> or <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>) and receive a [Land Contract](land-and-tool-contracts.md) of the same rarity and variant.

[Land Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md) can be used to mine [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) more efficiently by actively playing in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/).

:::info
If the dedicated trade-in feature doesnt work, simply send the Owner Shards directly to mint.rland to recieve Land Contracts.
