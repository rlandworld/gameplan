## What are BIT-NFTs?&#x20;

The mysterious BIT-NFTs were originally intended as an initial way to release R.Land's [BIT-Token](/tokenomics/bit-token) to the public. It was later revealed that BIT-NFTs can also be turned into [Tool Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md) for the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/).&#x20;

BIT-NFTs were first obtainable exclusively during the [BIT-NFT Pack](packs.md) Sale in November 2021. There are four different rarities available:

* &#x20;Multi BITs (Rare)
* &#x20;Silver BITs (Epic)
* &#x20;Gold BITs (Legendary)
* &#x20;<mark style={{ color:'purple' }}>Black Diamond</mark> BITs (Mythic)

Already got some BIT-NFTs? Awesome! You can trade them in to receive either [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) or [Tool Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md):

:::warning
Trading in BIT-NFTs for [Tool Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md) and [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) has reduced the available supply of these assets considerably. The supply will stay limited as there will be no additional sales of [BIT-NFT Packs](packs.md#bit-nft-pack-bit-box) in the future!
:::

:::info
Only 10 Mythic Black Diamond BIT-NFTs have been minted so far, but there is still a very small chance to find more inside one of the few remaining [BIT-NFT Packs](packs.md#bit-nft-packs-bit-box).
