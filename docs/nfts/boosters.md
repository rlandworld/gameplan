## What are Boosters?

Boosters are used in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) in order to increase the production of [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) for a specific amount of time. Each kind of Booster offers a different boost multiplier and boost duration depending on its [Rarity](boosters.md#rarities) and [Variant](boosters.md#variants).&#x20;

Boosters were first obtainable exclusively during the [Booster Pack](packs.md) Sale in January 2022.

:::warning
The supply of Booster NFTs is limited as there will be no additional sales of [Booster Packs](packs.md#booster-pack) in the future!
:::

:::success
You can send Boosters into the game by using the in-game interface on [R.Land](https://play.r.land/mine) or by sending them to "stake.rland" manually using AtomicHub's [NFT-Transfer Feature](https://wax.atomichub.io/trading/nft-transfer).&#x20;
:::

:::success
Boosters are available on [AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rland\&order=desc\&schema\_name=boosts\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) and the [R.Land Marketplace](https://market.r.land).

## Rarities

Boosters are available in four different rarities, with each rarity providing a different boost multiplier:

| Booster Rarity | Multiplier |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Rare           | 2x         |
| Epic           | 4x         |
| Legendary      | 6x         |
| Mythic         | 8x         |

:::success
Boosters with low mint numbers (#1 - #100) provide an additional bonus muliplier on top of their regular multiplier (increase of 0.01x with each lower mint number), starting at:

**+0.01x multiplier for mint #100** 

and increasing linearly up to:

**+1.00x  multiplier for mint #1**&#x20;

## Variants&#x20;

![All Four Booster Variants (Day, Week, Month, Once) In Epic Rarity](</img/4x_day.png>)

Each Booster [Rarity](boosters.md#rarities) is also available in one of four different variants, which determines the duration of the booster:

| Variant | Duration                    |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| Day     | 1 Day                       |
| Week    | 1 Week                      |
| Month   | 1 Month                     |
| Once    | One complete mining session |

:::warning
If you send a Booster from your [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet.md#wax-wallet) to your [In-Game Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet.md#in-game-wallet), the respective NFT will get burned and the Booster will be available in-game.
:::

:::warning
"Once" Boosters differenciate from other variants as they dont have a predetermined boosting duration. They are simply active for one complete mining session and will be used up once the respective mining session ends. Therefore, they are best used on high-level [Tools](lands-and-tools.md#tools) or [Tool Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md) with long mining sessions.&#x20;

Also be careful to not accidentally stop a mining session early when using a "Once" Booster, or the Booster will be gone immediatly!
:::

:::info
The duration of each mining session is determined by the level of your respective [Tool](/nfts/lands-and-tools) or [Tool Contract](land-and-tool-contracts.md). Each level equals one minute of mining time.

For example, at level 100 000 (current max. level available via [Upgrading](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading)) the mining session will last for 100 000 minutes (or 69.4 days). Consequently, "Once" Boosters have the highest boost duration potential among all variants.
:::

:::info
You can start and stop mining session with active "Day", "Week" or "Month" Boosters at any time. The remaining boost duration will always be reusable for another mining session (does NOT apply to "Once" Boosters, as they are used up once the respective mining session ends).&#x20;
