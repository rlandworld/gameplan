[Owner Shard](owner-shards-os.md) Packs were sold exclusively for Aether, the game token of the "R-Planet" project. The intention behind this was to support "R-Planet" while also giving the community a new use-case for their already owned assets.

:::info
R.Land started out as a community project based on the game "R-Planet". However, the scope of R.Land increased drastically over time and our project is now a completely independent metaverse.
:::

Inside these Packs, you will find [Owner Shards](owner-shards-os.md) in six different rarities (Common to Mythic) and four different variants ([<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas), [<mark style={{ color:'yellow' }}>Alloy</mark>](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas), [<mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark>](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) or [<mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas)) according to the following table:

:::info
Gold Packs were obtainable exclusively by blending a [Mythic Owner Shard Ticket](tickets.md#standard-owner-shard-tickets) or a [Guaranteed Whale Pack Ticket](tickets.md#guaranteed-owner-shard-tickets) during the [Owner Shard Blending Event](tickets.md#owner-shards-tickets). The Gold Pack offers the same odds as the Whale Pack.&#x20;

[BIT-NFT](bit-nfts.md) Packs were released on November 10th, 2021. Inside these packs you will find [BIT-NFTs](bit-nfts.md) in four different rarities (Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic). These are tradeable for either [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) or [Tool Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md), which are used in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/).

![BIT-NFT Pack AETHER Variant (BIT-Box AE)](</img/BIT_BOX_AE.png>) ![BIT-NFT Pack WAX Variant (BIT-Box XA)](</img/BIT_BOX_XA.png>)

There are two different variants of [BIT-NFT](bit-nfts.md) Packs available, namely "BIT-Box AE" (AETHER variant) and "BIT-Box XA" (WAX variant), which were sold for 2 500 000 AETHER and 20 WAX respectively. Their only difference is their optical appearance. Both variants contain identical rarity odds:

| BIT-NFT                    | Odds    |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Multi BIT (Rare)           | 50.00 % |

## Booster Packs

[Booster](boosters.md) Packs were released on January 8th, 2022. Inside these packs you will find ten [Boosters](boosters.md) in four different rarities (Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic) and four different variants (Day, Week, Month, Once).

![Booster Pack (BIT-Variant)](</img/BIT_boost\_comp.png>) ![Booster Pack (WAX-Variant)](</img/wax_Boost\_comp.png>) ![Booster Pack (TLM-Variant)](//img/TLM\_Boost\_comp.png)

![Booster Pack (AETHER-Variant)](</img/Aether_Boost\_comp.png>) ![Booster Pack (BLU-Variant)](</img/BLU_boost\_comp.png>) ![Booster Pack (NEFTY-Variant)](</img/NEFTY_boost\_comp.png>)

There were six different variants of Booster Packs available, depending on the token used for purchasing:

* BIT variant (initial price 95 000 BIT)
* WAX variant (initial Price 50 WAX)
* TLM variant (initial Price 120 TLM)
* AETHER variant (initial Price 23 500 000 AETHER)
* BLU variant (initial Price 34 000 BLU)
* NEFTY variant (initial Price 50 WAX, exclusively available on [NeftyBlocks](https://neftyblocks.com/))

Their only difference is their optical appearance. All variants contain identical rarity odds:

| Booster Rarity       | Odds    |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| Rare (2x Boost)      | 70.00 % |
| Epic (4x Boost)      | 18.00 % |
| Legendary (6x Boost) | 8.00 %  |
| Mythic (8x Boost)    | 4.00 %  |

Each of the above rarities can appear in four different variants (Day, Week, Month, Once):

| Booster Rarity | Odds    |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Day            | 70.00 % |
| Week           | 18.00 % |
| Month          | 8.00 %  |
| Once           | 4.00 %  |

For example: To get an "8x Day" Booster, the combined odds are `0.04 * 0.70 = 2.80%`.

:::info
A secret blend of all six Booster Pack variants will be available in the future. Rumors say that it might result in a permanent [Booster](boosters.md) for your precious [Lands](broken-reference).

## Daily Actions-NFT Packs

[Daily Actions-NFT](daily-actions-nfts.md) Packs were released on July 10th, 2022. Inside these packs you will find up to three [Daily Actions-NFTs](daily-actions-nfts.md) granting different amounts of [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) (DA).

<figure><img src="/img/DA_comp.webp" alt="" /><figcaption><p>Daily Action NFT Pack</p></figcaption></figure>

The initial pack price was 150$, exclusively purchasable in [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) (only for whitelisted players and for a limited amount of time). As of today, the drop is still publicly available on [R.Land](https://play.r.land/drop) for 200$ in [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) (discounts up to 75% for [Staking BOXEA-Tokens](/current-events/daily-actions-nft-pack-discount) may apply).

Each [Daily Actions-NFT](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) Pack includes two guaranteed [Daily Actions-NFTs](daily-actions-nfts.md) and also has a 10% chance for a 3rd additional Bonus [Daily Actions-NFT](daily-actions-nfts.md) (with 1000+ DA):

* The first NFT is guaranteed to drop and offers a random amount of [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) between 1 and 500.
* The second NFT is also guaranteed to drop, but offers a predetermined amount of [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) between 501 and 1 000, depending on the total amount of packs opened so far. A 501 [DA-NFT](daily-actions-nfts.md) is guaranteed in the very first opened pack (mint #1) and 1 000 [DA-NFT](daily-actions-nfts.md) is guaranteed in the very last opened pack (mint #500).
* A third bonus NFT has a 10% chance of dropping and also offers a predetermined amount of [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) starting at 1 001 DA (similar to how the second NFT works).

:::info
The mint number of each [Daily Actions-NFT](daily-actions-nfts.md) determines the amount of [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) it will provide.

For example: A [Daily Actions-NFT](daily-actions-nfts.md) with mint #568 will result in a 568 [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da).&#x20;
