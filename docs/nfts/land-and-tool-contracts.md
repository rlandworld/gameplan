## What are Land and Tool Contracts?&#x20;

Land and Tool Contracts NFTs are the basic assets to mine [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/). They grant a player access to mine on individual [Lands](/nfts/lands-and-tools) with dedicated [Tools](/nfts/lands-and-tools) in exchange for a [Rental Fee](land-and-tool-contracts.md#contract-rental-fees).&#x20;

Compared to [Public Mining (Free-To-Play)](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/public-mining-free-to-play), mining with Contracts has the potential to achieve a much higher mining output. Contracts are also the first step towards full [Land and Tool](lands-and-tools.md) ownership in R.Land.

There are two different types of Contracts available:

* **Land Contracts:**

  Owning [Land Contracts ](land-and-tool-contracts.md#how-to-get-land-contracts)gives you the _right_ to mine [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) on individual [Lands ](lands-and-tools.md#lands)in the R.Land [Mining Game.](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) 

  They are available in four different variants (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'orange' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>) and six different rarities ("Common" to "Mythic"). 

  Just like owned [Lands](lands-and-tools.md#lands), they can be [Upgraded](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading) to significantly increase their mining capacity (current max. level is 100 000), but a certain percentage of the mining proceeds will automatically be deducted as a [Rental Fee](land-and-tool-contracts.md#contract-rental-fees) depending on the Contract's rarity.\

* **Tool Contracts:**

  Owning [Tool Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md#how-to-get-tool-contracts) gives you the _right_ to mine [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) with dedicated [Tools ](lands-and-tools.md#tools)in the R.Land [Mining Game.](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) 

  They are available in six different rarities ("Common" to "Mythic"). 

  Just like owned [Tools](lands-and-tools.md#tools), they can be [Upgraded](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading) to increase their mining output and mining duration significantly (current max. level is 100 000), but a certain percentage of the mining proceeds will automatically be deducted as a [Rental Fee](land-and-tool-contracts.md#contract-rental-fees) depending on the Contract's rarity.

## How to get Land Contracts?

<center><img src="/img/All_Land_Contracts_rGas.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption><p>All Land Contract Rarities from Common to Mythic (<mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> Variant)</p></figcaption></center>

To get access to a specific Land Contract variant (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'orange' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> or <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>), you need to trade in an [Owner Shard](owner-shards-os.md) of the corresponding variant. The rarity of the Land Contract will be the same as the rarity of the used [Owner Shard](owner-shards-os.md).

Example:

| Receive Land Contract | Need to Trade-In |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
|  Common               |  Common OS       |
|  Uncommon             |  Uncommon OS     |
|  Rare                 |  Rare OS         |
|  Epic                 |  Epic OS         |
|  Legendary            |  Legendary OS    |
|  Mythic               |  Mythic OS       |

All Land Contract variants (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'orange' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> or <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>) are obtainable in the same way. Simply trade in a corresponding [Owner Shard](owner-shards-os.md) and receive a Land Contract of the same type and rarity.

:::warning
Trading in [Owner Shards](owner-shards-os.md) for Land Contracts will burn the respective NFTs!
:::

:::warning
The supply of [Owner Shards](owner-shards-os.md) is limited and there will be no additional sales of [Owner Shards Packs](packs.md#os-packs) in the future! Therefore the available amount of Land Contracts is limited as well.
:::

:::success
Trade-Ins for Land Contracts can be done directly on [R.Land/tradein](https://r.land/tradein).

## How to get Tool Contracts?&#x20;

<center><img src="/img/All_Tool_Contracts.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption><p>All Tool Contract Rarities from Wood (Common) to Black Diamond (Mythic)</p></figcaption></center>

In order to get access to Tool Contracts, you need to trade in either [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) or [BIT-NFTs](bit-nfts.md):

| Receive Tool Contract          | Need to Trade-In                                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wood Pickaxe (Common)          | 1 000 BIT-Tokens                                         |
| Stone Pickaxe (Uncommon)       | 2 000 BIT-Tokens                                         |
| Multi Pickaxe (Rare)           | Multi BIT-NFT                                            |
| Silver Pickaxe (Epic)          | Silver BIT-NFT                                           |
| Gold Pickaxe (Legendary)       | Gold BIT-NFT                                             |
| Black Diamond Pickaxe (Mythic) | <mark style={{ color:'purple' }}>Black Diamond</mark> BIT-NFT |

:::warning
Trading in [BIT-NFTs](bit-nfts.md) for Tool Contracts will burn the respective NFTs!
:::

:::warning
The supply of [BIT-NFTs](bit-nfts.md#what-are-bit-nfts) is limited and there will be no additional sales of [BIT-NFT Packs](packs.md#bit-box) in the future! Therefore, the available amount of "Rare" or higher rarity Tool Contracts is limited as well.

## Rental Fees

The amount of Rental Fees you have to pay for mining with Contracts is dependent on the Contract's rarity.

For **Land Contracts**:

| Land Contract | Rental Fee in % |
| ------------- | :-------------: |
| Common        |        10       |
| Uncommon      |        11       |
| Rare          |        12       |
| Epic          |        13       |
| Legendary     |        14       |
| Mythic        |        15       |

Identical Rental Fees apply to all Land Contract variants (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'orange' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> or <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>).

For **Tool Contracts**:

| Tool Contract                                             | Rental Fee in % |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: |
| Wood Axe (Common)                                         |        6        |
| Stone Axe (Uncommon)                                      |        7        |
| Multi Axe (Rare)                                          |        8        |
| Silver Axe (Epic)                                         |        9        |
| Gold Axe (Legendary)                                      |        10       |
| <mark style={{ color:'purple' }}>Black Diamond</mark> (Mythic) |        35       |

Don't want to pay Rental Fees for mining? Get full ownership of your [Lands and Tools](lands-and-tools.md) by trading in your Contracts at level 1 000 (or higher) together with either a [Bonus Ticket](tickets.md#land-and-tool-bonus-tickets) or [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token).
:::

## Obtaining ownership from Contracts

Contracts have the potential to be turned into fully owned [Lands and Tools](lands-and-tools.md), which (among several other [Ownership Benefits](lands-and-tools.md#ownership-benefits)) completely eliminates all [Rental Fees](land-and-tool-contracts.md#rental-fees) and will give you the option to earn from NFT [Advertisements](/upcoming-features/nft-skins-and-advertisments) in the future.

In order to achieve this, you need to [Upgrade](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading) your Contracts to level 1 000 (or higher) in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/). Once you have reached this threshold, you can either pay a certain amount of [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) or use a [Bonus Ticket](/nfts/tickets) to receive full ownership:

![Getting Tool Ownership](</img/Contracts\_to\_Tool\_Ownership_Kopie.webp>)

:::danger
If you have just leveled up your Contract in-game, you MUST wait at least 5 minutes before trading in the Contract for the ownership purchase! This time is needed for the blockchain to update the level data on your recently leveled up NFT.&#x20;

If ignored, the level data will potentially be lost, meaning you will lose all recently upgraded levels. To be sure, simply check if the level on the NFT matches the level shown in-game before trading in.

:::success
Using [Bonus Tickets](tickets.md) will grant you a permanent 10% bonus on your mining output.&#x20;
:::

Already got a Contract at level 1 000+? Great! You now have the opportunity to use one of two purchase options:

### Using [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token)

Send your level 1000 (or higher) Contract to `claim.rland` with the memo `purchase` using AtomicHub's [NFT-Transfer Feature](https://wax.atomichub.io/trading/nft-transfer).&#x20;

You will automatically receive an owned [Land or Tool NFT](lands-and-tools.md) of the same level, rarity and variant. The amount of [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) needed to buy the ownership will be deducted directly from your [WAX Wallet](/essentials/r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet). Purchase costs vary for each different Contract type and rarity:

For Land Contracts:

| Land Contract | Ownership Purchase Cost in BIT-Tokens |
| ------------- | :-----------------------------------: |
| Common        |                 3 750                 |
| Uncommon      |                 15 000                |
| Rare          |                 42 500                |
| Epic          |                 85 000                |
| Legendary     |                250 000                |
| Mythic        |               1 000 000               |

Identical purchase costs also apply to all Land Contract variants (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'orange' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> or <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>).

For Tool Contracts:

| Tool Contract                                             | Ownership Purchase Cost in BIT-Tokens |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------------: |
| Wood Axe (Common)                                         |                650 000                |
| Stone Axe (Uncommon)                                      |                650 000                |
| Multi Axe (Rare)                                          |                800 000                |
| Silver Axe (Epic)                                         |                900 000                |
| Gold Axe (Legendary)                                      |               1 000 000               |
| <mark style={{ color:'purple' }}>Black Diamond</mark> (Mythic) |               5 000 000               |

:::warning
Trading in Contracts for ownership will burn the respective NFTs!

Send your level 1 000 (or higher) Contract together with a matching [Bonus Ticket](tickets.md) (same rarity and variant) to `claim.rland` using AtomicHub's [NFT-Transfer Feature](https://wax.atomichub.io/trading/nft-transfer).&#x20;

You will automatically receive an owned [Land or Tool NFT](lands-and-tools.md) of the same level, rarity and variant with an additional 10% mining bonus! The mint number of the new NFT will be the same as the mint number of the used [Bonus Ticket](tickets.md).&#x20;

:::danger
When trading in Contracts together with [Bonus Tickets](tickets.md), make sure to only send one pair (1x Contract + 1x matching [Bonus Ticket](tickets.md)) at a time!
