## What are Tickets?

R.Land Ticket NFTs represent exclusive vouchers which grant access to special perks and assets. Currently, there are two types of Tickets available:

* "[Owner Shards Tickets](tickets.md#the-owner-shards-tickets)", which can be exchanged for [Owner Shards](owner-shards-os.md) and [Owner Shard Packs](packs.md).
* "[Land and Tool Bonus Tickets](tickets.md#pre-order-bonus-tickets)", which can be used to get full ownership of [Lands](broken-reference) and [Tools](broken-reference).

:::success
Tickets are available on [AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rland\&order=desc\&schema\_name=tickets\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) and the [R.Land Marketplace](https://market.r.land).

## Owner Shards Tickets

Owner Shard Tickets were obtainable exclusively during the "[Owner Shard](owner-shards-os.md) Blending Event" in October 2021.&#x20;

During this event, players were able to choose between two different blending options in order to receive either "[Standard Owner Shard Tickets](tickets.md#standard-owner-shard-tickets)" or "[Guaranteed Owner Shard Tickets](tickets.md#undefined)".

### Standard Owner Shard Tickets

## Land and Tool Bonus Tickets

[Land and Tool](lands-and-tools.md) Bonus Tickets were obtainable exclusively during the "Bonus Ticket Pre-Order Event" in May 2022.

They can be used to get immediate access to full [Land and Tool](lands-and-tools.md) ownership when traded in together with a matching [Contract](land-and-tool-contracts.md) at level 1000 (or higher). Additionally, you will be granted a permanent 10% mining bonus. Learn more about [Obtaining full Ownership from Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md#obtaining-full-ownership-from-contracts) using Bonus Tickets.

:::success
The mint number of the [Bonus Ticket](tickets.md) will also determine the mint number of newly owned [Land or Tool](lands-and-tools.md). Having lower mint numbers will play a prominent role in the future gameplay of R.Land!
