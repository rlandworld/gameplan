## Lands

Land NFTs are essential assets in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/), as they represent the player's personal _ownership_ of individual Lands. On owned Lands, you can mine [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) with any kind of [Tool](lands-and-tools.md#tools) or [Tool Contract](land-and-tool-contracts.md) without having to pay Land-[Rental Fees](land-and-tool-contracts.md#rental-fees).

Consequently, mining on owned Lands has the potential to achieve a much higher mining output compared to mining with[ Land Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md) or the alternative [Public Mining (Free-To-Play)](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/public-mining-free-to-play). In addition, Land ownership also grants access to a multitude of additional [Ownership Benefits](lands-and-tools.md#ownership-benefits).

Lands are available in four different variants (<mark style={{ color:'green' }}>Circuit</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'yellow' }}>Alloy</mark>, <mark style={{ color:'red' }}>rGas</mark> and <mark style={{ color:'blue' }}>Pixel</mark>) and six different rarities ("Common" to "Mythic"). All Lands can be [Upgraded](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading) to significantly increase their mining capacity (current max. level is 100 000).

Owning Lands also provides you with free [Daily Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) for in-game use.

### How to get Lands?

Owned Lands can be obtained by trading in a [Land Contract](land-and-tool-contracts.md) at level 1000 (or higher) together with either a [Land Bonus Ticket](tickets.md#land-bonus-tickets) or a certain amount of [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token). Learn more about [Obtaining full Ownership from Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md#obtaining-full-ownership-from-contracts).

Don't want to spend time [Upgrading](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading) your [Land Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md)? Owned Land NFTs are also available on [AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rland\&order=desc\&schema\_name=lands\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) and the [R.Land Marketplace](https://market.r.land).

## Tools

Tool NFTs are essential assets in the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/), as they represent the player's personal _ownership_ of dedicated mining Tools. With owned Tools, you can mine [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas) on any kind of [Land](lands-and-tools.md#lands) or [Land Contract](land-and-tool-contracts.md#what-are-land-and-tool-contracts) without having to pay Tool-[Rental Fees](land-and-tool-contracts.md#rental-fees).&#x20;

Consequently, mining with owned Tools has the potential to achieve a much higher mining output compared to mining with [Tool Contracts](land-and-tool-contracts.md) or the alternative [Public Mining (Free-To-Play)](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/public-mining-free-to-play). On top of that Tool ownership also grants access to a multitude of additional [Ownership Benefits](lands-and-tools.md#ownership-benefits).

Tools are available in six different rarities ("Common" to "Mythic"). All Tools can be [Upgraded](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/upgrading) to significantly increase their mining output and mining duration (current max. level is 100 000).
