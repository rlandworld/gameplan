# ðŸ†š R.Land In-Game Wallet vs. WAX Wallet

## R.Land In-Game Wallet vs. WAX Wallet

The R.Land In-Game Wallet and the official WAX Wallet are two different entities and have a couple of key differences and characteristics:

* R.Land's main token, "[BIT](/tokenomics/bit-token)", is the only token that can be transferred between your WAX Wallet and your R.Land In-Game Wallet, thus making it the sole R.Land token useable outside the game itself (which includes trading on exchanges like [Alcor](https://alcor.exchange/trade/bit-rland\_wax-eosio.token) or [Defibox](https://wax.defibox.io/marketDetail/131)).
* [In-Game Tokens](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/) (such as [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas), [Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da), [Experience Points](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp), etc.) are exclusively available in your R.Land In-Game Wallet and can **NOT** be withdrawn to your WAX Wallet directly.
* In order to use [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) from your WAX Wallet within the game, you need to first deposit them into your R.Land In-Game Wallet.
* In order to use [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) from your In-Game Wallet outside of the game, you need to first withdraw them to your WAX Wallet.
* Most of your R.Land assets will always remain in your WAX Wallet and do **NOT** need to be staked or transferred to your In-Game Wallet in order to play (does not apply to one-time use assets like [Boosters](/nfts/boosters) or [Tickets](/nfts/tickets)).
* In order to use your R.Land assets in-game, you just need to successfully link your WAX Wallet to your R.Land Wallet.
* Linking your WAX Wallet to your R.Land In-Game Wallet also acts as a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) security measure to protect your valueable assets.

## R.Land In-Game Wallet

When logging in on [R.Land](https://play.r.land/mine), you will have direct access to your own personal "In-Game Wallet". It does not only contain your in-game [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token), but also all other [In-Game Tokens](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/) such as [Resources](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/resources-alloy-circuit-pixel-rgas), [Actions](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/actions-sa-da) and [Experience Points](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/experience-points-xp).

The R.Land In-Game Wallet is managed by R.Land's dedicated servers and is decoupled from the [WAX Blockchain](https://on.wax.io/wax-io/). Interaction with the blockchain only happens when depositing or withdrawing [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token). 

As a result, playing R.Land requires only minimum resources to be staked to your WAX Wallet (CPU and NET) in order to process transactions, which is especially helpful for newcomers.

## WAX Wallet

The [WAX Could Wallet](https://all-access.wax.io/) (or other self-managed WAX Wallets like [Anchor](https://greymass.com/en/anchor/) or [Wombat](https://www.wombat.app/)) is a powerful but simple-to-use crypto wallet, that lets you log into any WAX Blockchain application (DApp's, such as R.Land) fast and seamlessly. It also allows you to use third-party marketplaces like [AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection\_name=rland\&order=desc\&sort=created\&symbol=WAX) or exchanges like [Alcor](https://alcor.exchange/).

Most of your R.Land assets will always remain stored in your personal WAX Wallet. The same applies to [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) that have been withdrawn from your R.Land [In-Game Wallet](creating-an-r.land-in-game-wallet.md) or have been bought on a third-party exchange.
