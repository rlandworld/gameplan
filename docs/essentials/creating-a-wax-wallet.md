## What is the WAX Blockchain?

WAX (The **W**orldwide **A**sset e**X**changeâ„¢) is the most used and transacted blockchain ecosystem in the world for NFTs, dApps and video games â€” providing the safest and most convenient way to create, buy, sell and trade both virtual and physical items to anyone, anywhere in the world. It is carbon neutral and runs on a "Proof of Stake" system, enabling free and fast transactions.

## How to create a WAX Wallet?

In order to get access to all of R.Land's features, you need to set up your own personal WAX Wallet. The easiest way to do this is by heading over to the official [WAX Website](https://all-access.wax.io/) and sign up for a WAX-Cloud-Wallet (WCW).&#x20;
