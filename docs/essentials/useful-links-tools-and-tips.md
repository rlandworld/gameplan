## Tips

### **Tip #1:** Add BIT-Token to your WAX Wallet!

Open your [WAX Wallet](https://wallet.wax.io/dashboard) and click on "Manage" (under "Tokens") -> "Add Custom Token". Now enter the following information for [BIT-Token](/tokenomics/bit-token) as shown below.

### Tip #2: Add R.Land's accounts as friends in AtomicHub!

Did you know? If you add official R.Land wallet addresses like `claim.rland` as a friend to your [AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/friends) account, the account name will show up automatically when you setup a transfer and start typing. By doing this so, you can avoid typos and potentially losing your valuable assets.

This also works for the other important R.Land wallet addresses like `mint.rland`, `stake.rland` etc.
