# ðŸ‘‹ Creating an R.Land In-Game Wallet

## 1. Sign up with your Socials or E-Mail

In order to get started in the world of R.Land, you need to setup an R.Land In-Game Wallet first. This can be done easily by visiting the official R.Land [Website](https://play.r.land/mine) and signing up with any of the following social network accounts:

* Google
* Facebook&#x20;
* Twitter&#x20;
* Microsoft
* Discord
* Apple (currently not available)

Alternatively, you also have the option to sign up via E-Mail Link as Dr. Baby Girl is showing below:

All your [In-Game Tokens](/tokenomics/in-game-tokens/) will be stored in your R.Land [In-Game Wallet](r.land-in-game-wallet-vs.-wax-wallet), which is automatically created once you successfully signed up.

## 2. Link your WAX Wallet to your R.Land In-Game Wallet (2FA)

Once you have successfully set up your R.Land In-Game Wallet, you will be automatically redirected to your personal homepage. \
\
At the very top of the page, click the "Link WAX Wallet"-Button:&#x20;

After logging in, you will be prompted to verify your WAX Wallet address. Click the "Verify"-Button:

Congratulations! You have now successfully linked your R.Land In-Game Wallet to your WAX Wallet.

Linking your WAX Wallet to your R.Land In-Game Wallet will act as a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to protect your valueable assets. Once you successfully linked your WAX Wallet, you will automatically have access to your R.Land NFTs.

If you simply want to try out the R.Land [Mining Game](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/) using the free-to-play option "[Mining on Public Land](/gaming/r.land-mining-game/public-mining-free-to-play)", you do not necessarily need to set up a WAX Wallet. \
\
However, if you want to withdraw your earned [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) in order to use them outsite of the game, you need to link your WAX Wallet first. The same applies to depositing [BIT-Tokens](/tokenomics/bit-token) into the game. Learn more about [Creating a WAX Wallet](creating-a-wax-wallet.md).
